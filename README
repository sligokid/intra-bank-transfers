This was a fun exercise, but time was very limited.

Questions:
Please also give us your answer to the following questions:
• How would you improve your solution?
	I would add Transaction support around the fund exchange.
	The HashCode / Equals methods need to be created for my own user defined Classes particularly since they are stored in collections.
	The Transfer history has not been implemented and that would need to be replicated off site
	I would use Spring or another dependency injection framework to manage the object creation.

• How would you adapt your solution if transfers are not instantaneous?
	Payments should be booked over a messaging middleware back to a clearing house
	This middleware(Rendezvous maybe) would guarantee delivery of the booking request by Queueing.
	This booking would be a publish downstream framework
